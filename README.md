# Friendly Dark Theme
## Presenting to you  Dark theme: "Friendly-DarkTheme" 

This is a uniquly designed Dark theme based on Dark+ & Monokai VSCode pre-installed themes as well as inheritance from many others like Atom One & Material Theme.

After searching many Dark themes in the marketplace, I finally decided to build my own vibrant and easy to read dark theme based colors, It supports many coding languages as well as coding styles.

Hope you like it,
